            <div class="course-description">In The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union, a six-hour course, we undertake a profound and thought-provoking journey through the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, guided by the narrative insights of Michael Malice. From the early days of anarchism and communism to the tumultuous events that led to the collapse of the Soviet empire, we explore the key figures, pivotal moments, and far-reaching consequences of this significant period in history. Across eight detailed and highly descriptive lectures, we analyze the reigns of Joseph Stalin and his successors, the Cold War era, and the roles played by Western leaders and intellectuals, ultimately witnessing the dramatic fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union itself.</div>

We delve into Plato's Dialogues, which capture Socrates' character and ideas, and expose the ignorance of assumed experts. The course covers Plato's Theory of Forms, his vision of the ideal city-state, and the afterlives of his ideas, tracing their influence through key figures and their fusion with Hebraic and Christian traditions. We conclude by discussing the enduring relevance of Platonic thought in mathematics, myth, and meaning, and its significance for navigating truth, knowledge, and the human condition in our current age.</div>

We examine how philosophers responded to the major events and challenges of the era, such as World War I, World War II, and the Holocaust, and how their ideas shaped political ideologies and global conflicts. The course also delves into the emergence of critical feminist and race theories, as well as the development of objective approaches to ethics and the debate surrounding the objectivity of science. Ultimately, we establish the profound influence of philosophy on history, demonstrating how philosophical ideas have the power to transform society and shape the course of human progress.</div>
